Signs of Life
-----

To know if a deep RL algorithm is working or not, we need to check for some basic signs of life. The simplest indicator is running average of reward and the total reward. A working algorithm should obtain rewards higher than competely random. 

Additionally, for a task in which success correlates with the number of time steps, check the episode length. If a task relies on quick completion, shorter episodes are better; if a task involves multiple stages, longer episodes are better.
